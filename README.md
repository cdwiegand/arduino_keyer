arduino_keyer
=============

A CW keyer for arduino connected to a relay or SSR (solid state relay). Currently, to use it either type text, or enter a command starting with backslash. The only command currently implemented is \wpm ## where ## is a word per minute. Note: using WPM over 25 or so may have unreliable timing, depending on your hardware.
